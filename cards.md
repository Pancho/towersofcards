#Cards

## Follow this template 
It's easier for parsing then :)

* Name
* Faction
* Type (tower, buff/debuff, target, global, add types here)
* Effect and procedure (in a simple language that's parsed and processed) - a string.
* Text
* Flavor text (or not)
* Path to image (full) or image slug (where the rest will be appended automatically)


Leave two empty lines after each card so a new list is constructed for the next one.
