# Questions

## Structure

Are there limitations on what kind of cards be played per tick?

Each phase has limitations for what cards can be played. EARLY cards can be in any stage

     PHASE EARLY  MID  LATE
CARD
EARLY        X     X
MID                X    X
LATE                    X
LASTS        5     3    *

* Two cards can be played per tick.
* You only get one card per tick.
* You can discard any number of cards
* At the start you get three cards.
* If at the end of tick you have three cards, random one is lost.
* Deck size 30

If tick length is 5 seconds, it means EARLY phase lasts 25 seconds, and mid phase 15 seconds.

How to avoid clickfest? Players should have meaningful choices.

At beginning new new attackers spawn. The attackers from the previous ticks continue in the next one.

## Targeting

Targeting is an attribute of towers and certain buffing cards (limited to humans).
I was thinking that the targeting could be an attribute on the tower card, and not adjustable afterwards.

## Spawning

* Creeps per each faction
  * How many creeps spawn at each base at each phase for each faction

## Deck structure

maximum 4 of the card. Cards from given faction allowed.

start with premade deck for each faction and start from there.
