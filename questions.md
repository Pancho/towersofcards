# Questions

## Structure

Are there limitations on what kind of cards be played per tick?

I like the idea that the early phase lasts longer than mid phase.

## Targeting

Do you mean that the targeting should adjustable per tower?

I was thinking that the targeting could be an attribute on the tower card, and not adjustable afterwards.

* How many phases 3 (EARLY, MID, LATE) or 4 (+ END)
* Should phases have rounds or just turns
	* Rounds can make games longer
	* Having just turns, creeps spawning at each tick, could speed things up
* How many turns per phase
* Faction specifics
* Creeps per each faction
* How many creeps spawn at each base at each phase for each faction
