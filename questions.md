# Questions

## Structure

Are there limitations on what kind of cards be played per tick?

I like the idea that the early phase lasts longer than mid phase.

## Targeting

Do you mean that the targeting should adjustable per tower?

I was thinking that the targeting could be an attribute on the tower card, and not adjustable afterwards.
